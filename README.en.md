## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 SDK
- PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS extension enabled
- TrackHub Authority Server running (for authentication)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shernandezp/TrackHub.Geofencing.git
   cd TrackHub.Geofencing
   ```

2. **Enable PostGIS extension** in PostgreSQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
   ```

3. **Configure the database connection** in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "ManagerConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=trackhub_manager;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Web
   ```

6. **Access GraphQL Playground** at `https://localhost:5001/graphql`

## Overview

The **TrackHub Geofencing API** provides services for managing the geofencing features of TrackHub. It adheres to the project's **Clean Architecture** principles, leveraging **GraphQL** for API interactions and **Postgres** for database management.

### Key Features

The API offers the following functionalities:
- Management of geographic boundaries, also known as geofences.
- Generating reports based on geofencing data.

---

## Entities

### Geofencing

- **Geofence**: Represents geographical boundaries using Postgres' PostGIS extension to handle spatial data.
- **GeofenceEvent**: Tracks transporter entry/exit events with timestamps and location. Events are created automatically when positions are processed and a transporter enters or exits a geofence.
- **VwUser**: A view of the user table within the geofencing schema, offering a simplified interface for accessing user-related data.
- **VwTransporterPosition**: A view that combines transporter data with their respective positions in geometry format for easy geospatial queries.

---

## GraphQL Operations

### Mutations

- **processPositions**: Processes transporter positions to detect geofence entry/exit events using NetTopologySuite's spatial `Contains()` method

### Queries

- **geofenceEventsAfter**: Retrieves events after a given cursor (event ID) for polling by downstream services. Supports cursor-based pagination where each consumer tracks their own position.
- **transportersInGeofence**: Gets all transporters currently within any geofence
- **geofenceEvents**: Retrieves geofence events for reporting, filtered by account, user, date range, and optional transporter. Returns transporter name, geofence name, entry/exit timestamps, total time, and coordinates.


### Why GraphQL?

The use of **GraphQL** enables efficient, customizable queries, letting clients request only the data they need to minimize bandwidth and enhance app performance. With GraphQL, applications can retrieve specific details about users, transporters, or devices, optimizing both operational efficiency and user experience.
